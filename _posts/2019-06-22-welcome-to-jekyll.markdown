I've decided to setup a blog on my personal domain [korijn.dev](https://korijn.dev) where I hope to occasionally write about [software engineering](https://github.com/korijn), drumming in two [metal](http://facadedoom.com) [bands](http://www.onheil.com/) and life.

Right now, this website can only be accessed through the apex domain, mostly due to an assumption on my part that [TransIP should be able to serve redirects over SSL](https://www.transip.nl/knowledgebase/idee/662-ssl-certificaten-op-de-doorstuurservice/) and the fact that [browsers are configured to prevent unsafe HTTP connections to .dev domains](https://get.dev/#benefits).

*[apex domain]: just "korijn.dev" without the "www." subdomain prefix
