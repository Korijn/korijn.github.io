Worked as a freelance webdesigner/programmer during high school.

Sold websites to companies ranging from starters to local shops, and a few relatively larger companies. The framework I built eventually included a shopping system with payment service integration for iDeal and an automated invoicing mechanism.

Programmed in PHP5, built a Framework using Smarty for templates and applied several design patterns such as Factories and Facades to have improved maintainability and adaptability. Designed using XHTML, CSS and jQuery.
