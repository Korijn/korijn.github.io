I was responsible for development, maintenance and deployment of many Microsoft technology-based applications, both on the web and in offline desktop/server environments. Technologies I worked with include C#, ASP.NET WebForms and WinForms, SQL Server and jQuery.

Some of the projects I've worked on included novel features, such as an automatic invoicing system that learns how to create invoices by watching its users create invoices, the First European E-money Trust project (FEET) featuring stackable internet payments, and a publication on incorporating jQuery into ASP.NET WebForms projects.
