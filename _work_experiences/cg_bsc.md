BSc Thesis internship on ðŸ“œ [Realistic Rendering Of Virtual Worlds](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ac506c311-6d79-4128-a7ad-707d59ce6048).

Implemented a deferred rendering pipeline in a team, using [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/), for Dr. ir. Ruben Smelik's [SketchaWorld](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-area/defence-safety-security/missions-operations/sketchaworld-from-sketch-to-virtual-world/), a terrain modeling framework that allows users to easily construct virtual worlds by means of sketching, to improve visual realism.
