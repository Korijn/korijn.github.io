                        Over the course of 2018, management responsibilities of human resources, sourcing and projects were transferred from our site manager to me. In 2019 my independence on this area of expertise was recognized by a promotion to the role of manager.

                    <p>
                        In 2016 Clinical Graphics was acquired by Zimmer Biomet. This provided our team with the knowledge required to enter the US market, a major undertaking that involves clearing the product with the FDA. Under my supervision the software development team delivered a completely rebuilt version of the product, engineered in compliance with applicable regulations such as BS EN 13485 and IEC 62304, playing a key role in the delivery of the service.

                    <p>
                        Over this period I have introduced many industry best practises into our software development process, such as automated testing, code review, continuous integration, code coverage, requirements management, traceability analysis, static analysis, infrastructure as code, continuous delivery, etc.

                        At Clinical Graphics, we develop software for medical applications, such as a pre-operative planning service for hip impingement surgery. Simulation results based on CT/MR scans are communicated to the clinician with revolutionary 3D PDF reports. These reports are visually oriented and interactive, putting the clinician in the driver‚Äôs seat to get the information he wants in support of his clinical decisions.

                        I was responsible for development, maintenance and deployment of many Microsoft technology-based applications, both on the web and in offline desktop/server environments. Technologies I worked with include C#, ASP.NET WebForms and WinForms, SQL Server and jQuery.

                    <p>
                        Some of the projects I've worked on included novel features, such as an automatic invoicing system that learns how to create invoices by watching its users create invoices, the First European E-money Trust project (FEET) featuring stackable internet payments, and a publication on incorporating jQuery into ASP.NET WebForms projects.

                        Worked as a freelance webdesigner/programmer during high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Programmed in PHP5, built a Framework using Smarty for templates and applied several design patterns such as Factories and Facades to have improved maintainability and adaptability. Designed using XHTML, CSS and jQuery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sold websites to companies ranging from starters to local shops, and a few relatively larger companies. The framework I built eventually included a shopping system with payment service integration for iDeal and an automated invoicing mechanism.

                        As a final science project I built a program for the school to send text messages to any combination of students, classes and clusters to notify them of changes in the schedule or other important messages. The program was also connected to the school's administrative system for easy importing of data. Students could manage their own phone number on a user-friendly portal so this process wouldn't demand extra investments from the school.
